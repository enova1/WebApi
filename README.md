# Web API Project

This is a Web API project built with .NET 8 and C#. It does not have authentication or authorization implemented. This API is consumed by Blazor, ReactJS, and MVC sites. Future enhancements are planned, including the addition of SQLite and Entity Framework.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any other preferred code editor

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Web API project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://git@github.com:enova1/WebApi.git
   ```

2. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio**:
   - Open Visual Studio.
   - Navigate to File > Open > Project/Solution.
   - Select the `.sln` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Build the Solution**:
   - Once the solution is loaded, build the solution to restore dependencies:
     ```
     Ctrl + Shift + B
     ```

4. **Run the API**:
   - Set the API project as the startup project.
   - Press `F5` or click on the Start Debugging button to run the API.

5. **Test the API**:
   - Once the API is running, you can test its endpoints using tools like Postman or by consuming it from my Blazor(https://github.com/enova1/Blazor), ReactJS (https://github.com/enova1/ReactJS), or MVC (https://github.com/enova1/MVC) example sites.

## Future Enhancements

- **Add SQLite**: Future enhancements include adding SQLite as the database provider for the API.
- **Implement Entity Framework**: Entity Framework will be implemented for data access and management in future iterations.
